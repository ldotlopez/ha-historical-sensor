Feed historical data into Home Assistant database. 

HomeAssistant architecture is built around polling (or pushing) data from devices, or data providers, in "real-time". Some data sources (e.g, energy, water or gas providers) can't be polled in real-time or readings are not accurate. However reading historical data, like last month consumption, it's possible and accurate. This module adds support to this.

This module uses the `recoder` component and custom state creation to store states "from the past".

Current projects using this module:

- [ideenergy energy monitor](https://github.com/ldotlopez/ha-ideenergy)


## Technical details

Q. How it's accomplished?.

A. It's a relatively easy answer but needs to be broken into some pieces:
  
  1. A new property for sensors: `historical_states`. This property holds a list of `HistoricalState`s which are, basically, a `state`+`datetime`  (with tzinfo), soâ€¦ the data we want.

  2. A new hook for sensor: `async_update_historical_states`. This method is responsible to update `historical_states` property.  
     **This is the only function that needs to be implemented**.

  3. A new method, implemented by HistoricalSensor class: `async_write_ha_historical_states`. This method handles the details of creating tweaked states in the past and write them into the database using the `recorder` component of Home Assistant core.

Q. Something else?

A. Historical sensors can't provide the current state, Home Assistant will show "undefined" state forever, it's OK and intentional.
