Feed historical data into Home Assistant database.

HomeAssistant architecture is built around polling (or pushing) data from devices, or data providers, in "real-time". Some data sources (e.g, energy, water or gas providers) can't be polled in real-time or readings are not accurate. However reading historical data, like last month consumption, it's possible and accurate. This module adds support to this.

This module uses the `recorder` component and custom state creation to store states "from the past".

Current projects using this module:

- [ideenergy energy monitor](https://github.com/ldotlopez/ha-ideenergy)
- [AuroraPlusHA](https://github.com/LeighCurran/AuroraPlusHA)


## Technical details

Q. How it's accomplished?.

A. It's a relatively easy answer but needs to be broken into some pieces:

  1. A new property for sensors: `_attr_historical_states`. This property holds a list of `HistoricalState`s which are, basically, a `state` value and a `dt` `datetime`  (with tzinfo), soâ€¦ the data we want.

  2. A new hook for sensor: `async_update_historical`. This method is responsible to update `_attr_historical_states` property.
     **This is the only function that needs to be implemented**.

  3. A new method, implemented by `HistoricalSensor` class: `async_write_ha_historical_states`. This method handles the details of creating tweaked states in the past and write them into the database using the `recorder` component of Home Assistant core.

Q. Something else?

A. Historical sensors can't provide the current state, Home Assistant will show "undefined" state forever, it's OK and intentional.


### External vs. internal statistics

Due to the way the data is inserted a posteriori into the recorder, Home
Assistant cannot calculate statistics on historical states automatically.  This
is particularly problematic for the Energy dashboard, which relies on these
statistics.

It is possible to provide those statisticts by

  1. Providing a `get_statistic_metadata` method returning a dictionary of
     supported statistics. Generally, the sum is sufficient for the energy
     dashboard, so setting `has_sum` to True is all it takes

  2. Providing an `async_calculate_statistic_data` method to do the calculation.
     It will take a list of `HistoricalState`, and the latest
     `homeassistant.components.recorder.statistics.StatisticsRow` as arguments,
     and should return an array of
     `homeassistant.components.recorder.models.StatisticData` (with `start`,
     `state` and the statistics, e.g., `sum`).
